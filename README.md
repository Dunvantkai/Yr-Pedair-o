# Yr-Pedair-o
Pedair-o is my version of tetris for the bbc model b which is a computer that was released in the 1980 by acorn.
I chose the name Pedair-o (Welsh for (The four of))as a nod to the name "tetris" as it is derived from the Greek prefix "tetra" meaning to having four parts (as every block in teras is make up of blocks)
the program was writen in bbc basic which is a dumbed down vertion of Basic it's self
