## Behind the name
I chose the name Pedair-o (Welsh for (The four of))as a nod to the name "tetris" as it is derived from the Greek prefix "tetra" meaning to having four parts (as every block in teras is make up of four blocks)
## how it was programed and how to run it your self
the program was writen in bbc basic which is a dumbed down vertion of Basic it's self
