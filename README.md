# Yr-Pedair-o
Pedair-o is my version of tetris for the bbc model b which is a computer that was released in the 1980 by acorn.
I chose the name Pedair-o (the welsh for (The four of))as a nod to the name "tetris" as it is derived from the Greek prefix "tetra" which refers to the four squares contained in each block (as every block in teras is make up of blocks)
